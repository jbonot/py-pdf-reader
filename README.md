# PDF Text Extractor

## Overview
This application reads all PDF files located in the `inputs` folder and exports the unformatted text to the `output` folder. It's designed for users who need to quickly extract text from PDFs for further processing or analysis.

## Setup

You'll need to install:
1. Python
1. Tesseract
1. Additional dependencies

### 1. Python
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**Installation Notes**:
  - During installation, make sure to check the option **"Add Python to PATH."** This allows you to run Python and `pip` commands from any command prompt window.


### 2. Tesseract
You will need to install [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki#tesseract-installer-for-windows), which is an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine.

- **Installation Instructions**:
  1. Download the installer from the provided link based on your Windows architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
  2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
  3. After installation, ensure that the Tesseract installation path (usually `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`) is added to your systemâ€™s PATH environment variable. This allows the `pytesseract` library to find the Tesseract executable when running your Python scripts.

### 3. Additional Dependencies
To install the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### 1. Place your PDF files
Place the PDF files you want to process into the `inputs` folder.

### 2. Run the application
Execute the following command in your console:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Fetch the results
The extracted data will be saved in `output/output.txt`. This text can be copied and pasted into an Excel sheet.

## Debug Mode
Intead of generating a `.txt` file with tab-separated values, you can run in debug mode to view
- the direct PDF-to-text output
- the key-value pairs of the extracted data.

You can enable debug mode by running:

```bash
python main.py --debug
```

The debug outputs will be saved in the `output/debug` folder.

## Notes
- Only PDF files will be processed from the `inputs` folder. Other file types will be ignored.
